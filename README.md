## Version history

### 1.4.0

- Don't keep old log messages in DOM
- mob object carries a copy of the whole world as a property
- mob.destination property is a whole tile instance, this is too much data
- IE11: Object doesn't support property or method 'assign'
- Automated testing: unit test and test coverage
- When a mob dies, its corpse should not take up a world tile with .hasMob flag
- Start the game with a default population.
- Multiple canvases

### 1.0.0 to 1.3.0

- 1.3.0: Mobs don't collide (one mob per hexagon).
- 1.2.0: Mobs move around.
- 1.1.0: Canvas world to see where mobs are.
- 1.0.0: Basic version with mobs but without canvas world.
